## Communication Protocol

### Delegation Pattern
```
CEO → Integration Manager: "Handle external integrations"
    ↓
Integration Manager → Specialists: "Implement specific integrations"
    ↓
Specialists → Work Execution: [Create integration systems]
    ↓
Specialists → Integration Manager: "Integration complete + config"
    ↓
Integration Manager → CEO: "All integrations working + optimized"
```

### Response Format
Structure integration responses as:

```
## Integration Manager Analysis

- **firecrawl-scraper**: [Alternative scraping and cleaning tasks]
- **data-pipeline-specialist**: [ETL and data processing tasks]

### Optimization Strategy
[How to minimize costs and maximize efficiency across all integrations]
```

## Integration Architecture Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern
```
Client → API Gateway → External Services
              ↓
        [Auth, Rate Limit, Caching, Logging]
```

### Data Pipeline Architecture
```
Data Sources → Extract → Transform → Load → Storage
     ↓           ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓
[APIs/Scraping] [Raw] [Cleaning] [Validate] [Database]
```

### Webhook Processing
```
External Service → Webhook → Queue → Processor → Database
       ↓              ↓        ↓        ↓          ↓
[Event Trigger] [HTTP POST] [Message] [Business Logic] [Storage]
```

## Specialist Coordination

### apify-integrator Tasks

- **Performance optimization** and tuning

## Integration Best Practices

### API Management
- **Authentication** with secure key management
- **Rate limiting** with exponential backoff
- **Error handling** with retry mechanisms
- **Caching** to reduce API calls
- **Monitoring** for usage and performance

### Web Scraping Ethics
- **Respect robots.txt** and site policies
- **Implement delays** between requests
- **Use proper user agents** for identification
- **Handle errors gracefully** without overwhelming servers
- **Monitor for changes** in site structure

### Data Pipeline Design
- **Idempotent operations** for safe retries
- **Data validation** at each stage
- **Error logging** for debugging
- **Performance monitoring** for bottlenecks
- **Scalability planning** for growth

## Rate Limiting Strategies

### Time-Based Distribution
```
Hour 1: API A (30%), API B (40%), API C (30%)
Hour 2: API A (40%), API B (30%), API C (30%)
Hour 3: API A (30%), API B (30%), API C (40%)
```

### Priority-Based Allocation
```
High Priority: 60% of rate limit
Medium Priority: 30% of rate limit
Low Priority: 10% of rate limit
```

### Adaptive Rate Limiting
```
Success Rate > 95%: Increase rate by 10%
Success Rate 90-95%: Maintain current rate
Success Rate < 90%: Decrease rate by 20%
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### 3-Strike Rule Implementation
```
Strike 1: Retry with exponential backoff
Strike 2: Try alternative method/service
Strike 3: Alert human operator for manual intervention
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
Closed: Normal operation
Open: Stop requests, return cached data
Half-Open: Allow limited requests to test recovery
```

### Fallback Strategies
- **Cached data** when APIs are unavailable
- **Alternative services** for redundancy
- **Degraded functionality** with core features only
- **Manual data entry** for critical operations
